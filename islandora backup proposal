# Islandora Backup Proposal

Preservation within the repository context utilizes a variety of strategies to ensure the successful longterm stewardship of assets.  

These activities<sup>1</sup> typically include:

     * archival formats
     * normalization
     * format migration
     * _bitstream copying_
     * fixity checking
     * documentation of file formats

This proposal is an attempt to provide a discussion starter about a bitstream copying (implementing a a backup strategy/plan) within the Islandora context.

## Backup Plan

At UPEI our Backup Plan includes a backup to both the network filesystem (spinning disk) and LTO5 tape on the following schedule:

     * daily incremental
     * weekly differential
     * monthly full backups

We use [Bacula](http://www.bacula.org/) to manage our backups.

### What gets backed up?

In addition to our production servers, we backup our database servers, and storage for data created during our digitization workflow.

## Implementing a Generic Backup Strategy for Islandora

One of the key features we are missing in our current backup plan is remote storage of assets. We've explored various options and Paul Pound developed the [Vault module](https://github.com/ppound/cirrostratus_assimilate) that utilizes [CloudSync](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/CLOUDSYNC11/Fedora+CloudSync+1.1) to store Fedora content to a [DuraCloud](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DURACLOUDDOC/Release+Notes) instance.

### Proposed Use Cases

**Backup Use Cases**
* a user is able to back up their Islandora site (Drupal filesystem, Drupal database, Fedora digital objects)
* a user is able to back up selected portions of their Islandora site (eg. just the Drupal filesystem, and/or the database, and/or the Fedora objects)
* a user can schedule backups
* a user can manually initiate a backup
* a user is able to direct their backup to a multiple destinations. For example:
 * the same filesystem
 * a local network filesystem
 * a cloud service
* there can be multiple methods for transferring backups. For example:
 * FTP
 * SFTP
 * RSync
 * BitTorrent
 * Swift
 * other
* a user is able to construct various backup scenarios. For example:
* create a backup of the Drupal filesystem and database and download it to their local machine
* create a backup of Islandora objects and select Amazon S3 as a destination.
* For Islandora Objects, a user may want to select the full FOXML object or only selected datastreams
* A backup of an Islandora object should record a [replication event](http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/preservation/eventType/rep.html) to the AUDIT datastream
* Additional preservation metadata should be recorded as part of the backup process (eg. a checksum of files at time of backup should be recorded and compared)

**Restore Use Cases**
* a user is able to restore a full backup
* a user is able to selectively restore an object (eg. restore a single Islandora object)

** Report Use Cases**
* a user can review the list of backups performed.
* a user can compare the checksum of a backed up item with the checksum originally recorded.

### Implementation

Drupal has a well supported module - [Backup and Migrate](https://www.drupal.org/project/backup_migrate) - that provides a flexible backup framework for Drupal sites.  Using an existing Drupal module that provides a fair amount of functionality and support for many of the use cases 'out-of-the-box' may be more sustainable.  Adopting an exist module also allows potential contributions back to the module, and by managing this function in the Drupal layer may make the solution more resilent in the future with Fedora4 integration.

The [Backup and Migrate](https://www.drupal.org/project/backup_migrate) module has default support for:

* Backup/Restore multiple MySQL databases and code
* Backup of files directory is built into this version
* Add a note to backup files
* Smart delete options make it easier to manage  backup files
* Backup to FTP/S3/Email or NodeSquirrel.com
* Drush integration
* Multiple backup schedules
* AES encryption for backups

Given the plugin architecture of the [Backup and Migrate](https://www.drupal.org/project/backup_migrate) module, the Drupal community has contributed additional addon modules including:

* Backup and Migrate SFTP - Backup to SFTP (tested this and it doesn't work with the current version of B&M)
* Backup and Migrate Dropbox - Backup to Dropbox (likewise tested this and it doesn't work with the current version of B&M)
* Backup and Migrate Rackspace Cloudfiles - Backup to Rackspace Cloudfiles
* HPCloud - Backup to HPCloud

When you combine the functionality of the [Backup and Migrate](https://www.drupal.org/project/backup_migrate) module with Mark Jordan's [Islandora Bagit](https://github.com/islandora/islandora_bagit) module a number of our Islandora object use cases become possible. The [Islandora Bagit](https://github.com/islandora/islandora_bagit) module packages up Islandora (Fedora) digital objects and their metadata into a format that can be shared between applications/systems. The module provides a plugin architecture for creating bags and includes:

* plugin_object_archivematica_transfers
* plugin_object_ds_add_file
* plugin_object_ds_basic
* plugin_object_foxml
* plugin_object_premis

When utilizing [Islandora Bagit](https://github.com/islandora/islandora_bagit) users can configure where their bags are stored (eg. sites/default/files/bags) which makes them accessible to the [Backup and Migrate](https://www.drupal.org/project/backup_migrate) module.

To get a proof of concept pulled together I think there are two use cases we should investigate:

* individual object packaged as a Bag backed up to a service like Amazon S3 (in theory the current set of modules/functionality should support this)
* serialized objects (eg. an Islandora collection) stored in a single Bag backed up to Amazon Glacier.

**FOXML BagIt Approach**

As a starting point we may want to consider limiting our BagIt configuration to store the FOXML of the object (plugin_object_foxml). This bag would contain the default BagIt files and for the Fedora Object both Inline datastreams and Managed datastreams - all Managed Content datastreams will have the datastream content Base64-encoded within the digital object export file), eliminating the need to develop restore methods based on content models. 

* potential issues
  * the checksums used in the Bag are SHA1, while the Islandora default is MD5 (though SHA1 is an option).
  * the checksum in the Bag is applied to the FOXML file itself, not the individual datastreams
  * there currently isn't a restore for FOXML files, though [Tuque supports the creation of objects based on FOXML](https://github.com/Islandora/tuque/blob/1.x/FedoraApi.php#L1057-L1141).
  * What happens on restore? I think this is potentially snarly.

**Individual Datastreams Approach**

This approach will require additional thought.  The potential benefits of this approach include:

* the user can be selective (eg. only Bag the OBJ and MODS ds)
* each datastream will be stored individually within the Bag and will have its own checksum.
* complicates the restore process. Would we need to embed the associated Islandora CModel as part of the bag? Would we bag up objects based on their content models? eg. use a directory structure to separate those out? Additional layers of admin screens would be needed.
* the B&M module provides a note field for the backup ... would we insert cmodel details there?

What else?
